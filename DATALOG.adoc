==  Usage - differences to XTDB 1.x

=== Architecture

Where XTDB 1.x has a transaction log, document store and query indices, Core2 has a transaction log and an object store.

* XTDB 1.x transactions are split up into 'tx-events' and documents, with the former going on the tx-log and the latter to the doc-store.
  In Core2, the transaction log doesn't need to have infinite retention, so we no longer need this split - transactions go straight on to the log, and the document store is obsolete.
* Rather than each node having its own query indices, Core2 shares these between nodes in a cluster via the object store.
  The object store is hence _the_ golden store, thanks to the transience of the transaction log.
* The files stored in the object store are in https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] format, the structure of which Core2 takes responsibility for maintaining - we no longer require a KV store.

=== Setup

Main require: `[core2.api :as c2]`

Configuration uses https://github.com/weavejester/integrant[Integrant].

You can still start a completely in-memory node using `(core2.local-node/start-node {})`.
For a Kafka/JDBC node:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {:core2.kafka/log {:bootstrap-servers "localhost:9092"}

                                   :core2.jdbc.postgres/dialect {}
                                   :core2.jdbc/default-pool {:db-spec {:user "postgres"
                                                                       :password "postgres"
                                                                       :database "core2test"}}
                                   :core2.jdbc/object-store {}})]
  ;; ...
  )
----

The CLI parameters, and EDN/JSON configuration file formats are the same as XTDB 1.x.

=== Transactions

Transactions are slightly different to XTDB 1.x:

- `[:xtdb.api/put <doc>]` -> `[:put <doc>]`. Put and delete supported thus far.
- `:xt/id` -> `:_id`. Valid ID types currently strings, numbers, dates.
- `c2/submit-tx` returns `CompletableFuture`, deref it to get the transaction details.

=== Datalog Queries
In a similar manner to `next.jdbc`[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc], execute Datalog queries in Core2 using `c2/plan-datalog-query`.
This returns a reducible sequence that you can pass to (say) `reduce`, `into` or `run!`.
When finalised (by `reduce`) this will ensure the query results are adequately closed.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                              '{:find [?e ?name]
                                :where [[?e :name ?name]]})
       (into [])))
----

These queries currently return a vector of maps `[{:e ..., :name ...}, {...}]`, although this is only because it's what was closest to what we had available at the time.

=== SQL queries

Same as Datalog, but use `plan-sql-query` instead.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (->> (c2/plan-sql-query node "SELECT u.name FROM users u")
       (into [])))
----


=== Bases

Core2 doesn't have the concept of DBs - instead, we pass the node and (optionally) a 'basis' to queries.
In Core2, the upper bound for the tx-time is applied per-source; the default upper bound for VT is applied at the query level - this is because each data source has their own tx-time timeline, but VT is assumed to be a single timeline, consistent across data sources.

[source,clojure]
----
;; simple case - use the latest tx the node has available:
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node '{...})
     (into []))

;; or, to read your own writes (timeout optional):
;; `plan-datalog-query` will await the transaction
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find ..., :where ...}
                                (assoc :basis {:tx tx}
                                       :basis-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1))))
     (into []))
----

The `plan-datalog-query` functions take the node, the query, and then a variable number of params.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query tu/*node*
                            (-> '{:find [?e]
                                  :in [?first-name ?last-name]
                                  :where [[?e :first-name ?first-name]
                                          [?e :last-name ?last-name]]}
                                (assoc :basis {:tx tx}))
                            "Ivan" "Ivanov")
     (into #{}))
----

Unlike Datomic, `$` shouldn't be included in `:in` - if/when we reinstate multiple sources to Datalog queries, I propose we include them as a named map in the basis-opts:

[source,clojure]
----
;; something like this, anyway.
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find [...]
                                  :where [[$db1 ...], [$db2 ...]]}
                                (assoc :basis {'$db1 {:tx tx}
                                               '$db2 {:tx tx}}
                                       :basis-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1))))
     (into []))
----

`plan-datalog-query-async` is the same, except it runs entirely asynchronously and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the query plan.
(In fact, `plan-datalog-query` just calls `plan-datalog-query-async` and deref's it.)

The basis map can also contain a `:default-valid-time` option, which applies to any entities that don't specify other valid-time constraints.
This is for repeatable queries - it defaults to 'now' if not provided.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find [?e ?name]
                                  :where [[?e :name ?name]]}
                                (assoc :basis {:default-valid-time #inst "..."})))
     (into []))
----

There is also `op/query-ra` which accepts a lower-level relational algebra query - have a look in `core2.logical-plan` for what can go into these plans, and `core2.tpch-queries` for examples.

SQL queries do not currently support bases.
