== Developing

- Start and connect to your REPL in the usual fashion
- `(dev)`
- `(go)`
- `node` is then bound to a started node, using `data/dev-node` as a persistent data directory
- `lein test` to run unit tests, `lein test :integration` to run integration tests
- To attach YourKit, `lein run with-profile +attach-yourkit repl :headless` (assumes YourKit in `/opt/yourkit` as installed by the AUR)

== Differences to Classic

Main require: `[core2.core :as c2]`

Transactions are slightly different to Classic:

- `[:crux.tx/put <doc>]` -> `{:op :put, :doc <doc>}`. Put and delete supported thus far.
- `:crux.db/id` -> `:_id`. Valid ID types currently strings, numbers, dates.
- `c2/submit-tx` returns `CompletableFuture`, deref it to get the transaction details.

Core2 has the concept of 'db's, similar to `crux/open-db` but (as yet) without the ability to specify VT/TT.

At the moment, the main query function is on the node itself, `plan-q` taking a 'db' and a relational-algebra query plan.
Have a look in `core2.logical-plan` for what can go into these plans, and `core2.tpch-queries` for examples.
