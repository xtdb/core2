==  Usage - differences to Classic

=== Architecture

Where Classic has a transaction log, document store and query indices, Core2 has a transaction log and an object store.

* Classic transactions are split up into 'tx-events' and documents, with the former going on the tx-log and the latter to the doc-store.
  In Core2, the transaction log doesn't need to have infinite retention, so we no longer need this split - transactions go straight on to the log, and the document store is obsolete.
* Rather than each node having its own query indices, Core2 shares these between nodes in a cluster via the object store.
  The object store is hence _the_ golden store, thanks to the transience of the transaction log.
* The files stored in the object store are in https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] format, the structure of which Core2 takes responsibility for maintaining - we no longer require a KV store.

=== Setup

Main require: `[core2.api :as c2]`

Configuration uses https://github.com/weavejester/integrant[Integrant].

You can still start a completely in-memory node using `(core2.local-node/start-node {})`.
For a Kafka/JDBC node:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {:core2.kafka/log {:bootstrap-servers "localhost:9092"}

                                   :core2.jdbc.postgres/dialect {}
                                   :core2.jdbc/default-pool {:db-spec {:user "postgres"
                                                                       :password "postgres"
                                                                       :database "core2test"}}
                                   :core2.jdbc/object-store {}})]
  ;; ...
  )
----

The CLI parameters, and EDN/JSON configuration file formats are the same as Classic.

=== Transactions

Transactions are slightly different to Classic:

- `[:xtdb.api/put <doc>]` -> `[:put <doc>]`. Put and delete supported thus far.
- `:xt/id` -> `:_id`. Valid ID types currently strings, numbers, dates.
- `c2/submit-tx` returns `CompletableFuture`, deref it to get the transaction details.

=== Datalog Queries
In a similar manner to `next.jdbc`[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc], execute Datalog queries in Core2 using `c2/plan-datalog-query`.
This returns a reducible sequence that you can pass to (say) `reduce`, `into` or `run!`.
When finalised (by `reduce`) this will ensure the query results are adequately closed.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                              '{:find [?e ?name]
                                :where [[?e :name ?name]]})
       (into [])))
----

These queries currently return a vector of maps `[{:e ..., :name ...}, {...}]`, although this is only because it's what was closest to what we had available at the time.

=== SQL queries

Same as Datalog, but use `plan-sql-query` instead.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (->> (c2/plan-sql-query node "SELECT u.name FROM users u")
       (into [])))
----


=== Bases

Core2 doesn't have the concept of DBs - instead, we pass the node and (optionally) a 'basis' to queries.
In Core2, the upper bound for the tx-time is applied per-source; the default upper bound for VT is applied at the query level - this is because each data source has their own tx-time timeline, but VT is assumed to be a single timeline, consistent across data sources.

[source,clojure]
----
;; simple case - use the latest tx the node has available:
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node '{...})
     (into []))

;; or, to read your own writes (timeout optional):
;; `plan-datalog-query` will await the transaction
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find ..., :where ...}
                                (assoc :basis {:tx tx}
                                       :basis-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1))))
     (into []))
----

The `plan-datalog-query` functions take the node, the query, and then a variable number of params.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query tu/*node*
                            (-> '{:find [?e]
                                  :in [?first-name ?last-name]
                                  :where [[?e :first-name ?first-name]
                                          [?e :last-name ?last-name]]}
                                (assoc :basis {:tx tx}))
                            "Ivan" "Ivanov")
     (into #{}))
----

Unlike Datomic, `$` shouldn't be included in `:in` - if/when we reinstate multiple sources to Datalog queries, I propose we include them as a named map in the basis-opts:

[source,clojure]
----
;; something like this, anyway.
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find [...]
                                  :where [[$db1 ...], [$db2 ...]]}
                                (assoc :basis {'$db1 {:tx tx}
                                               '$db2 {:tx tx}}
                                       :basis-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1))))
     (into []))
----

`plan-datalog-query-async` is the same, except it runs entirely asynchronously and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the query plan.
(In fact, `plan-datalog-query` just calls `plan-datalog-query-async` and deref's it.)

The basis map can also contain a `:default-valid-time` option, which applies to any entities that don't specify other valid-time constraints.
This is for repeatable queries - it defaults to 'now' if not provided.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> (c2/plan-datalog-query node
                            (-> '{:find [?e ?name]
                                  :where [[?e :name ?name]]}
                                (assoc :basis {:default-valid-time #inst "..."})))
     (into []))
----

There is also `op/query-ra` which accepts a lower-level relational algebra query - have a look in `core2.logical-plan` for what can go into these plans, and `core2.tpch-queries` for examples.

SQL queries do not currently support bases.

== Developing Core2

Core2 is a mono-repo - we develop it from the root directory of the git repository.

* First time: `./bin/prep.sh`
* `./bin/re-prep.sh` to re-run `javac` if you change Java classes
* Start and connect to a REPL at the top-level of the project - this starts a REPL with all of the modules available.
+
For Emacs/CIDER:
* grab the `:lib/kaocha` and `:repl/cider-refactor` aliases from https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn/blob/live/deps.edn[John's deps.edn]
* then `./bin/cider.sh`, and `cider-connect-clj` (`, s c j` in Spacemacs)

* `(dev)`
* `(go)`
* `node` is then bound to a started node, using `dev/dev-node` as a persistent data directory

Linting:
* `clojure -Xlint` - runs clojure-lsp's `diagnostics`.
* `clojure -Xlint :namespace '[core2.foo]'` - same, for given namespaces.

* https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/xtdb/core2[Continuous Integration (CircleCI)]
* link:bibliography.org[bibliography.org] - a list of light bedtime reading.

=== Testing

* Test all with `clj -X:test`; `clj -X:integration-test` for longer tests
* Some tests have external dependencies which require `docker-compose`:
  * `docker-compose up` (`docker-compose up <postgres|kafka>` etc for individual containers),
  * `clojure -X:jdbc-test` / `clojure -X:kafka-test`
  * `docker-compose down`

=== Profiling

To attach YourKit:

* Install YourKit (it's on the AUR, for Arch folks)
* Add an alias to `~/.clojure/deps.edn`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:yourkit {:jvm-opts ["-agentpath:/opt/yourkit/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so"]}}}
----
* `clj -A:yourkit -M:repl/cider`

=== Building Core2

==== Maven Central

TODO: migrate from Lein

Core2 artifacts are deployed to Maven Central.

* To deploy a `dev-SNAPSHOT` release, `./lein-sub deploy`
* To deploy a release, `CORE2_VERSION=<version> ./lein-sub do install, deploy`, then head to the https://oss.sonatype.org/[Nexus UI] to close/release it.

==== Uberjar

TODO: migrate from Lein

* `./lein-sub do clean, install`
* `lein uberjar` => `target/core2-standalone.jar`

* `java -jar target/core2-standalone [--help]`

==== Docker

* `./bin/build-docker.sh [--clean]` => `juxt.xtdb-labs/core2:latest`
* `CORE2_VERSION=<version> ./bin/build-docker.sh` to tag as a different version.

== Arrow Fork

We maintain a fork of [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) to fix a couple of issues in `DenseUnionVector` - see [this diff](https://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/master...juxt:master) for more details.

To upgrade Arrow:

* Usual bump in `project.clj`
* Clone the [Arrow repo](https://github.com/apache/arrow), add the [JUXT fork](https://github.com/juxt/arrow) as a remote.
* Rebase `juxt/master` on the upstream tag.
* In Core2, `./bin/rebuild-forked-arrow-files.sh`
* Test
* Push (`--force-with-lease`) to JUXT fork, and commit to Core2.
