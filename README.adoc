== Developing

- Start and connect to your REPL in the usual fashion
- `(dev)`
- `(go)`
- `node` is then bound to a started node, using `data/dev-node` as a persistent data directory
- `lein test` to run unit tests, `lein test :integration` to run integration tests
- To attach YourKit, `lein run with-profile +attach-yourkit repl :headless` (assumes YourKit in `/opt/yourkit` as installed by the AUR)

== Differences to Classic

Main require: `[core2.core :as c2]`

=== Transactions
Transactions are slightly different to Classic:

- `[:crux.tx/put <doc>]` -> `{:op :put, :doc <doc>}`. Put and delete supported thus far.
- `:crux.db/id` -> `:_id`. Valid ID types currently strings, numbers, dates.
- `c2/submit-tx` returns `CompletableFuture`, deref it to get the transaction details.

=== DBs
Core2 has the concept of 'db's, similar to `crux/open-db` but (as yet) without the ability to specify VT/TT.
While there is `c2/await-tx-async` and `c2/open-db-async`, these (by their async nature) involve a bit of boilerplate.
Instead, we have `with-db-async` and `with-db` (sync) macros, which combine awaiting a transaction, and opening/closing a DB:

[source,clojure]
----
;; simple case - use the latest tx the node has available:
;; will return the result of the `with-db` block
(c2/with-db [db node]
  ...)

;; or, to read your own writes (timeout optional):
;; `with-db` will await the transaction
(let [tx (c2/submit-tx node [...])]
  (c2/with-db [db node {:tx tx, :timeout (Duration/ofMillis 250)}]
    ...))

;; in tests, we often inline `tx`:
(c2/with-db [db node
             {:tx (c2/submit-tx node [...])}]
  ...)
----

`with-db-async` is the same, except it runs entirely asynchronously and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the value returned from the block.
(In fact, `with-db` just calls `with-db-async` and deref's it.)

=== Queries
In a similar manner to `next.jdbc`[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc], execute Datalog queries in Core2 using `c2/plan-q`.
This returns a reducible sequence that you can pass to (say) `reduce`, `into` or `run!`.
When finalised (by `reduce`) this will ensure the query results are adequately closed.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (c2/start-node {})]
  (c2/with-db [db node]
    (into [] (c2/plan-q '{:find [?e ?name]
                          :where [[?e :name ?name]]}
                        db))))
----

These queries currently return a vector of maps `[{:e ..., :name ...}, {...}]`, although this is only because it's what was closest to what we had available at the time.

Note the param order is query then database (different to Classic, same as other EDN Datalog databases) - this is because Core2 queries can accept multiple DBs.

There is also `c2/plan-ra` which accepts a lower-level relational algebra query - have a look in `core2.logical-plan` for what can go into these plans, and `core2.tpch-queries` for examples.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (c2/start-node {})]
  (c2/with-db [db node]
    (into [] (c2/plan-ra '[:scan [{name (> name "Ivan")}]] db))))
----
