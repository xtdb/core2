# Crux Datalog

*Multidimensional Datalog Engine*

**Experimental**

See https://github.com/juxt/crux

## Scope

*Update, Feb 2020:* I'm now building a Datalog engine with
Prolog-syntax. It's written in Clojure and based on Apache
Arrow. Joins will be supported using a single, multi-dimensional,
index. Storage will be distributed.

While its scope is smaller, the ambition is that it will do the things
it does with speed and economy.

It's lower-level than Crux, but could become useful on its own. Parts
might later be ported to Rust. Crux bitemporal semantics will be
possible to implement on top of it.

*Earlier brief, still somewhat true:* The plan of attack using
Rust+Arrow to build a bitemporal Datalog engine based on columnar
formats using a set of primitives somewhat inspired by KDB to
implement the engine itself. See spikes under [rust](rust).

### Goals

* Apache Arrow
* JSON documents
* Worst Case Optimal Joins
* Basic Graph Patterns only
* Bitemp implemented as lower level join operators
* Point-in-time and valid-time range queries
* Range update semantics
* Nanosecond precision
* Clojure to Rust JNR bridge

### Stretch Goals

* LUBM / WatDiv
* Layered architecture for comparing performance and complexity of modules
* Succinct indexes
* Ingest
* Remote storage
