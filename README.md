# crux.rs

**Experimental**

Parts of Crux re-imagined in Rust (nightly).

See https://github.com/juxt/crux

[Earlier, now outdated plan for Q1 2020](plan.md)

## Scope

*Update, Feb 2020:* I'm now building a Datalog engine with
Prolog-syntax. It's written in Clojure and based on Apache
Arrow. Joins will be supported using a single, multi-dimensional,
index. Storage will be distributed.

While its scope is smaller, the ambition is that it will do the things
it does with speed and economy.

It's lower-level than Crux, but could become useful on its own. Parts
might later be ported to Rust. Crux bitemporal semantics will be
possible to implement on top of it.

Work currently happens here: [examples/arrow-jnr/]


*Earlier brief, still somewhat true:* The plan of attack using
Rust+Arrow to build a bitemporal Datalog engine based on columnar
formats using a set of primitives somewhat inspired by KDB to
implement the engine itself.

### Goals

* Apache Arrow
* JSON documents
* Worst Case Optimal Joins
* Basic Graph Patterns only
* Bitemp implemented as lower level join operators
* Point-in-time and valid-time range queries
* Range update semantics
* Nanosecond precision
* Clojure to Rust JNR bridge

### Stretch Goals

* LUBM / WatDiv
* Layered architecture for comparing performance and complexity of modules
* Succinct indexes
* Ingest
* Remote storage

## Building

First, you need `rustup`, see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

You also need `libclang` installed, as the wrappers for the C
libraries depend on this to build. On Ubuntu this can be done via `apt
install llvm-dev libclang-dev clang`.

```bash
cargo build
```

## Linting

You need Clippy installed via `rustup component add clippy`. To lint
everything, including examples:

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Running the Kafka KV Example

You need Kafka and Zookeeper running, see https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

``` bash
RUST_LOG=debug BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092 cargo run --example kafka_kv_store
```

KV data is stored under `data`.
