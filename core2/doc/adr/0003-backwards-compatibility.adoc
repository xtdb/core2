## Context

XTDB needs some level of compatibility with classic. At the minimum we
need to import the data and timeline.

link:0004-eviction.adoc[Eviction] is assumed to be orthogonal.

## Decision

N/A. This ADR has been superceded as it is too all-encompassing. We
will need to decide on a case-by-base basis what elements of classic
compatibility we want to commit to.

## Consequences
