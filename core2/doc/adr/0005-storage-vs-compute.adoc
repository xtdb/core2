= 5. Storage vs compute

== Context

XTDB is a deterministic database based on a single log of proposed
transactions. Each node indexes the log independently and serve queries.

We want to avoid each node to store its own local index. This is to:

[arabic]
. Avoid duplicating the index on each node.
. Make nodes easy to add and remove without replaying the full log.
. Make the full index able to far exceed each nodeâ€™s local disk size.

== Decision

We will support two simple extension points:

[arabic]
. Object store. This is a eventually consistent key/value store, like
for example S3.
. Log. This is a totally ordered log of proposed transactions, like for
example a Kafka topic with a single partition.

The index is written in chunks to a shared object store. As these chunks
are a function of the log, all nodes will reach the same conclusion and
upload the same immutable chunks to the object store.

== Consequences

Nodes will be tailing the log, and all persistent data is stored in the
shared object store. Nodes will cache immutable chunks of data locally
for query processing.

Nodes can come and go elastically in the cluster and will only have to
catch up from the latest chunk.

=== Known issues

[arabic]
. The design leads to rework across nodes.
. link:0004-eviction.adoc[Eviction] breaks the deterministic and
immutable model.
