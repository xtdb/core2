= 15 Classic Clojure Predicates

Date: 2021-09-14

== Status

Proposed

== Context

The direction in c2 is to not support arbitrary Clojure predicates. For
performance reasons we should still implement typed, fast predicates for
the ``supported'' language.

That said, we can also support a :default in the multi-method which
unwraps any special representation (like a Date being a long internally)
and invoke a normal Clojure function, and then coerce the result back.
Doesnâ€™t exist but not hard to build.

Arbitrary Clojure functions in queries can be enabled via a flag.

== Consequences
