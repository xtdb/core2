= 17 Classic Arbitrary Types

Date: 2021-09-14

== Status

Proposed

== Context

We would move towards c2â€™s Arrow based data model, see
link:0002-data-model.adoc[ADR-0002].

Nippy (or arbitrary Java objects) will not be supported in XTDB by
default but this Arrow extension type can be enabled via a flag. These
columns will be Arrow varbinary to non-JVM users.

== Consequences
