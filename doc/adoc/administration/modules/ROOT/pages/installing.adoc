= Installation

== Mounting a Volume

You can use the standard Docker flags to mount a volume and persist your XTDB Core2 data between restarts.
While Core2 is experimental, we recommend persisting data to `/tmp` so it is easy to destroy:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -p 5432:5432 -v /tmp/xtdb:/var/lib/xtdb xtdb/core2
----
