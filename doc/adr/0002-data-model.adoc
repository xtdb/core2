= 2. Data model

Date: 2021-09-09

== Status

Accepted

== Context

XTDB is a dynamic document database and needs a clearly defined data model.

== Decision

We will use https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] which is an emerging industry standard for columnar data.

Arrow supports nested data via lists and structs, and supports dynamic typing via unions.

=== EDN

Support for 'standard' EDN will be provided via Arrow extension types over the following Arrow types:

. persistent list - list.
. persistent set - list.
. char - uint2.
. keyword - varchar.
. symbol - varchar.
. uuid - fixedsizebinary(16). 7 map with arbitrary keys - map.

Non-Clojure users will simply see the basic Arrow type.

== Consequences

All internal query processing will use Arrow.
Persistent storage in XTDB are all valid Arrow IPC files.
Arrow IPC generated by other tools should be possible to query via XTDB seamlessly and vice versa.
