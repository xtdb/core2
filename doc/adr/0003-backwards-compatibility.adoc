## Context

XTDB needs some level of compatibility with classic. At the minimum we
need to import the data and timeline.

### Transaction processing (write side)

#### Rollback

Currently c2 takes a zero-copy of the live data and present that for
queries. The easiest way to do rollbacks is to do this the other way
around. Have the transaction take a zero-copy slice, modify it (append
only) and then if it commits, replace and release (decrease the
reference count) of the previous watermark.

The temporal in-memory index is a persistent data structure, so you
wouldn't need to do anything here, just go back to the previous
version.

#### See Also

* [Eviction](0004-eviction.adoc), assumed to be orthogonal.

## Decision

N/A. This ADR has been superceded as it is too all-encompassing. We
will need to decide on a case-by-base basis what elements of classic
compatibility we want to commit to.

## Consequences
