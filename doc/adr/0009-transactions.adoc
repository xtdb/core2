= 9. Transactions

Date: 2021-09-09

== Status

Proposed

== Context

XTDB is a deterministic, dynamic document database.
It doesnâ€™t (for the foreseeable future) support interactive transactions.
A transaction is instead proposed asynchronously onto a central, totally ordered log.
The transaction might get rejected during processing.
All nodes process all transactions in parallel and must reach the same result.

=== Format

A transaction is composed of a series of operations executed in order.

Options:

. EDN (classic): put/delete/evict and integrity checks via match + find.
. SQL DML: insert/update/delete/evict and integrity checks via select.

Operations also need to be able to do bitemporal corrections.

== Decision

We will support EDN-style transactions to start, either in EDN, JSON or raw Arrow.

As per the link:0002-data-model.adoc[data model], the transactions are converted to Arrow client side before submitted.

Integrity checks are done via queries and transaction functions should not be supported by default.
Transactions are proposed and can be rejected.

We need a way to override the system (transaction) time, mainly to be used for initial import or migration.
The system time still needs to be monotonically increasing.

== Consequences

Transactions must be fully deterministic as all nodes needs to reach the same conclusion and also share the same object store.

If a transaction has committed could potentially be figured out via querying the transaction id column.

SQL:2011 always assumes start/end time for corrections, while classic supports calculating the end time if not given.
The core needs to support both.
