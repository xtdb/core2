# 11. Classic tx-fn

Date: 2021-09-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Provide classic-like functionality for tx-fns.

Currently users can submit/trigger tx-fns via HTTP or the peer-like
API, therefore this ADR expects to maintain this.

There is no ADR currently for allowing users to trigger/manage tx-fns
via SQL, whereby normal SQL transactions would be the expected
correlating behavour.

## Decision

Transaction functions were not originally to be supported in XTDB SQL
as it requires strict determinism.

## Consequences

There may be some confusion/tension/discussion around a clean/pure
remote-first API supporting what is minimally needed by SQL & Datalog
users, and where the boundary lies between supporting classic like
functionality exclusively for Clojure/Datalog users.
