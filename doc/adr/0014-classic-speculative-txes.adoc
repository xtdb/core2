# 14 Classic-like Speculative Transactions

Date: 2021-09-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The easiest way to do this is c2 is to take defensive (or
copy-on-write) copies of the live roots in the watermark (a watermark
is kind of like a db in c2). This is a bit slow, but fundamentally
doable. Note that all data won't be needed to be copied, just the
current slice and the current in-memory temporal index.

### Rollback

Currently c2 takes a zero-copy of the live data and present that for
queries. The easiest way to do rollbacks is to do this the other way
around. Have the transaction take a zero-copy slice, modify it (append
only) and then if it commits, replace and release (decrease the
reference count) of the previous watermark.

The temporal in-memory index is a persistent data structure, so you
wouldn't need to do anything here, just go back to the previous
version.
