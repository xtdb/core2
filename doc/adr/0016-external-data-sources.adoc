= 16 External data sources

Date: 2021-09-14

== Status

Proposed

== Context

=== Multiple and external data sources

The c2 logical plan and Datalog supports multiple data sources. We can
also relatively easily support other Arrow sources of data, like CSV,
Avro, JDBC, JSON, Parquet etc. which would bring features classic
currently doesn’t have. There’s a CSV spike, but area requires more
work, but with good cost / benefit, and can be farmed out to someone
else.

== Consequences
