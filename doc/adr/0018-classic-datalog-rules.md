# 18 Classic Datalog Rules

Date: 2021-09-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Some easier rules can be compiled to our fixpoint operator in c2, more
advanced rules quite hard to do in the generic case. There's a
potential direction where you create ad-hoc operators for them
somehow. To be explored. Quite chunky piece of work risk-reward-wise.

## Consequences
