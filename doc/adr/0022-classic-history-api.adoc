# 22 History API

Date: 2021-09-14

## Status

Proposed

## Context

If we want to keep supporting it until we have full temporal support
(including transaction time), we can simulate it via the scan operator
I think.

If the history API can be superseded by the new temporal query
capability, we could also consider NOT supporting classic-like history
API.

## Consequences
