# 23. SQL nested data

Date: 2021-10-06

## Status

Proposed

## Context

XTDB needs easy ways of working with dynamic, nested data. SQL:1999
provides most (or all) of the primitives to do this in a standards
compliant way. In some places we will want to mildly extend or abuse
existing syntax to make it less verbose.


### Option: Build on SQL:1999 user defined types and collections

This is my preferred option. SQL actually provides the syntax for
almost everything we want to do, if not always in the most succinct
way. SQL has arrays (NOTE: they use one-based indexing), and
row-types, which are tuples / structs.

This paper
http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper5.pdf[Management of
Flexible Schema Data in RDBMSs] argues for this approach. In XTDB we
also only have a single backing Arrow data model, and there's no need
to pretend that some of it is JSON or XML etc.

One can refer to nested elements inside structs, using the expected
syntax:

SELECT foo.bar
FROM foo
WHERE foo.bar.baz = 1

Here foo is a correlation name (variable), bar is a column containing
a row with (at least) a field baz. The entire row (struct) foo.bar is
returned.

#### Arrays

Arrays are accessed as such in the standard, note the cross join:

SELECT baz.*
FROM foo, UNNEST(foo.bar) AS baz

Here foo is a correlation name (variable), bar is a column containing
an array.

Note that SQL arrays work differently from cardinality many in Datalog
or SPARQL, one has to explicitly deal with them.

#### Structs

One issue in standard SQL is that the way to instantiate a row type is
this:

ROW ('foo', 1)

Using the standard, to add field names, one can explicitly cast it,
but this forces one to also add types:

CAST (ROW ('foo', 1) AS ROW (name VARCHAR, id BIGINT) )

Another standard compliant approach is to use either a user defined
routine invocation or to instantiate a user defined type:

STRUCT (name => 'foo', id => 1)

NEW STRUCT (name => 'foo', id => 1)

As can be seen, SQL provides a syntax for named arguments. STRUCT here
could be seen as a user defined routine or struct we provide.

Another way to create rows is to introduce a syntax similar to the
SQL:2016 JSON_OBJECT function:

STRUCT('name': 'foo, 'id': 1)

Note that the keys are expressions here, and can actually be
calculated during the query in this approach.

A third alternative is to tweak the ROW syntax, so it optionally
supports either of the above constructs:

ROW (name => 'foo', id => 1)

A fourth alternative is to leverage SQL/PGQ which has syntactic
support for embedded maps, though this is really only allowed within
their sub-language:

{name: 'foo', id: 1}

This approach is also not consistent with SQL arrays, which cannot be
constructed without the ARRAY keyword. So going down this path one
should consider making that optional as well. This literal approach is
a bit closer to PartiQL (see below).

What to consistently call these row types is another question. They
are all technically ROW types in SQL, but could be considered either
STRUCT, OBJECT or MAP etc. optionally with an XTDB prefix. JDBC and
Arrow calls these structs.

Note that because XTDB supports the full Arrow data model, we cannot
just overload JSON_OBJECT for this purpose, as that implies the JSON
data model. Also, JSON_OBJECT is only a small part of the massive
SQL/JSON extension, which we don't want to support right now, as the
entire idea of XTDB is that you store documents.

See also https://rockset.com/docs/data-types/ which similar to PartiQL
has its own JSON-like literals and also their own functions to deal
with these. Like JSON, it calls rows objects. Like standard SQL they
use one-based indexing for arrays.

### Option: PartiQL / SQL++

https://partiql.org/assets/PartiQL-Specification.pdf[PartiQL] is based
on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3631.pdf[SQL++] and is an extension of
SQL-92 to support nested, dynamic data. It has some interesting ideas
and will at least be used as a reference and prior-art.

That said, the fact that it's based on SQL-92 is pragmatic - this is
the version of SQL most people are familiar with - but also
problematic, as this is a 30-year old specification, and modern SQL
has evolved a lot since. As mentioned in the first option, SQL:1999
contains most of the building blocks we need. This would been less of
a problem if we actually targeted SQL-92, but we target SQL:2011 (at
least).

That said, there are a few superficially nice things about PartiQL:

1. JSON-like literal syntax.
2. Arrays use zero-based indexing.
3. Support for MISSING vs NULL.
4. No need for UNNEST, ARRAY or ROW constructs.

Example without UNNEST, s.readings is an array:

FROM sensors AS s, s.readings AS r

PartiQL also adds several small extensions to SQL, like PIVOT, UNPIVOT
and SELECT VALUE, and requires the user to grok the semantics of these
to fully leverage it.

## Decision

We will build on standard SQL and extend it just a tiny bit to
simplify instantiate row types.

## Consequences
