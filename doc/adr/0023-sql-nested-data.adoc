# 23. SQL nested data

Date: 2021-10-06

## Status

Proposed

## Context

XTDB needs easy ways of working with dynamic, nested data. SQL:1999
provides most (or all) of the primitives to do this in a standards
compliant way. In some places we will want to mildly extend or abuse
existing syntax to make it less verbose.

## Consequences
