= 26. SQL property graph queries

Date: 2021-10-06

== Status

Proposed

== Context

XTDB needs a simple way to do graph traversals.
SQL/PGQ provides basic path queries without resorting to `WITH RECURSIVE`.

Supporting SQL/PGQ we also avoid the need to drop into Datalog for many cases, making SQL more competitive when querying graphs.

SQL/PGQ is a read-only subset of the upcoming https://www.gqlstandards.org/[GQL standard] embedded in SQL via the GRAPH_TABLE construct.
It looks somewhat like this:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT g.*
FROM GRAPH_TABLE ( myGraph,
  MATCH
    (Creator IS Person WHERE Creator.email = :email1)
    -[ IS Created ]->
    (M IS Message)
    <-[ IS Commented ]-
    (Commenter IS Person WHERE Commenter.email = :email2)
  COLUMNS ( M.creationDate, M.content ) ) AS g
----

As can be seen, the contents of the `MATCH` clause are inspired by https://opencypher.org/[openCypher].

How to interpret the edges properly is open for analysis.
Something like `IS Created` (can also be written as `:Created`) could be seen as the attribute to follow from the source table.
We wonâ€™t have properties on the edges, so we could consider only supporting the subset we can support.
The graph names are not directly relevant either.

SQL/PGQ is expected to be part of SQL:2022.
