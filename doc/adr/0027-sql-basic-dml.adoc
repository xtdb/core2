= 27. SQL basic DML

Date: 2021-10-06

== Status

Proposed

== Context

XTDB needs a simple way to manipulate data from SQL even if we donâ€™t initially support full SQL DML.
This is so a user can use XTDB with SQL only end to end.

We want to support the basic `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements.
`MERGE` can provide some level of conditional processing.
We probably want to introduce an `EVICT` statement as well.

What constitutes a table will be defined in link:0025-sql-tables.adoc[SQL Tables].
