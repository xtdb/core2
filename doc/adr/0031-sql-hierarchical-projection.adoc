= 31. SQL hierarchical projection

Date: 2021-12-01

== Status

Proposed

== Context

XTDB is a dynamic document database and needs to be able to construct
and project out hierarchical composite values in the `SELECT`
clause. In SQL, this usually means a mix of `ARRAY_AGG`, constructs
like `JSON_OBJECT` and nested sub-queries in the `SELECT` to build up
the tree structure one wants to project.

We want at minimum make this possible via existing SQL constructs, see
also link:0023-sql-nested-data.adoc[ADR-0023]. On top of this we
may also want syntactic sugar which is translated to the former that
makes it more natural to use, similar to how PartiQL allows JSON-like
syntax embedded in SQL.

This feature is in the same space as EQL pull and GraphQL.
