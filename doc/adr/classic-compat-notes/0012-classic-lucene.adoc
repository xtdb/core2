= 14 XTDB 1.x lucene

Date: 2021-09-14

== Status

Proposed

== Context

Support XTDB 1.x-like lucene functionality in Datalog

A c2-native solution would be to have secondary indexes participate in finish chunk, and maybe also a collective LSM-style merge process.
Temporal could maybe also use this capability if it existed.

Current plan is that there will be no Lucene support initially, and if we build it this wonâ€™t sit in the compatibility layer.

== Consequences
