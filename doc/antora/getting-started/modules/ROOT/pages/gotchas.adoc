There are two major categories of surprising behaviour in XTDB 2.x to watch out for.

1. XTDB 2.x is an immutable, bitemporal, schemaless database. If you are accustomed to other SQL dialects already, our SQL dialect will have some surprising quirks. We hope some of those quirks are a pleasant surprise, though.
2. Since XTDB 2.x is an experimental pre-alpha, many features are missing or incomplete.


== XTDB SQL Dialect

=== No Table Definitions

The first quirk you are likely to notice is that you can simply execute `INSERT` statements without executing any DDL.
XTDB is schemaless and does not require table definitions.

=== `SELECT *`

The second quirk you will notice is closely related to the first.
Because XTDB is schemaless, `SELECT *` is not straightforward to implement.
Clarifying
https://github.com/xtdb/core2/blob/master/doc/adr/0030-sql-missing-attributes.adoc[ADR 030]
is a high priority for us, after which we can implement `SELECT *`.
However, this dialect note will remain, as XTDB's `SELECT *` behaviour (once it exists) is bound to feel unfamiliar to some.

=== No Schema Discovery

Although records do have their own schema, and it is possible to produce discoverable schemas in XTDB,
this has not been implemented yet.

=== Typos

No schema means a small typo in a column name may return nothing, we would in practice recommend using a text editor/linter
capable of spotting your typos.

=== Jagged Rows

As you might expect from a schemaless database, the following is perfectly valid:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO people (xt$id, name) VALUES (1, 'Floh');
INSERT INTO people (xt$id, first_name, last_name) VALUES (2, 'Martha', 'Joseph');
----

Deciding what to do about missing attributes is, again, discussed in
https://github.com/xtdb/core2/blob/master/doc/adr/0030-sql-missing-attributes.adoc[ADR 030].

=== Case Sensitivity

Currently, XTDB's SQL identifiers are case-sensitive.
This will be corrected in https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/416[Issue #416].

The place this is most likely to cause confusion is between `SYSTEM_TIME` / `APPLICATION_TIME` (which are reserved words) and `xt$system_from` / `xt$system_to` / `xt$valid_from` / `xt$valid_to`, which are built-in column names.

In general, it is safe to assume reserved words are either uppercase or case-insensitive and column names should be lower-case.

=== Identifiers

XTDB only permits one identifier: a column named `id`.
Compound ids are not possible.

=== Uniqueness Constraints

XTDB does not (currently) support uniqueness constraints.

=== Triggers

XTDB does not (currently) support triggers.


== Missing and Incomplete

=== `SELECT *`

 Because XTDB is schemaless, `SELECT *` presents some difficulties.
While we fully intend to implement `SELECT *`, it requires the addition of `MISSING` semantics which are still under discussion.
See https://github.com/xtdb/core2/blob/master/doc/adr/0030-sql-missing-attributes.adoc[ADR 030] for more details.

=== Erasure

Although the `ERASE` statement currently works, erased documents are only hidden from view.
The XTDB process which will ultimately perform the erasure has not been written yet.
Erasure adds the inherent complexity of mutation to an otherwise immutable system and must be approached carefully.

=== `pgwire`

Not all Postgres Wire Protocol features are completely implemented yet.

=== Arrays and Objects

Support for Arrays and Objects (nested data) was added quite recently and probably still has quite a few bugs.

Due to https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/440[Issue #440], referring to a field from an indexed array does not work yet:

[source,sql]
----
user.friends[2].name -- fails
----

=== Row Types

Row Types (`ROW ()`) and User-Defined Types (`CREATE TYPE`) are not implemented yet.

=== Other Missing SQL Features

A query which attempts to use a SQL feature that hasn't been implemented yet should return an explicit error, as per https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/337[Issue #337].
