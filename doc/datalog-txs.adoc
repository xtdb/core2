= Datalog transactions

This document assumes you are roughly familiar with XTDB 1.x transactions - if not, no worries, the documentation is https://docs.xtdb.com/language-reference/datalog-transactions/[here].

Transactions are submitted via `xt/submit-tx`, and are comprised of put and delete operations.

In 2.x, all documents belong in a 'table' (e.g. `:users`), provided as part of each transaction operation.

== `:put` operations:

At their simplest, `:put` operations consist of the table to put the document into, and the document itself.
Documents must have an `:xt/id` attribute, which is considered unique within the table.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.datalog :as xt])

(xt/submit-tx your-node
              [[:put :users {:xt/id :jms, :first-name "James"}]
               [:put :users {:xt/id :jdt, :first-name "Jeremy"}]])
----

`:put` operations optionally take temporal parameters, in order to put the document for a subset of valid time.
By default, documents are asserted from the current time to the end-of-time, but this can be customised using `:for-valid-time [:in start-time end-time]` :

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.datalog :as xt])

(xt/submit-tx your-node
              [[:put :users {:xt/id :jms, :first-name "James"}
                {:for-valid-time [:in #inst "2020-02-01" #inst "2020-05-01"]}]

               [:put :users {:xt/id :jdt, :first-name "Jeremy"}
                {:for-valid-time [:in #inst "2019-05-01"]}]])
----

== `:delete` operations

Delete operations consist of the table to delete the document from, and the document's id.
Similarly to `:put`, they optionally take temporal parameters, in order to delete the document for a subset of valid time.

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/submit-tx your-node
              [[:delete :users :jms]

               [:delete :users :jdt
                {:app-time-start #inst "2023-04-01"
                 :app-time-end #inst "2023-05-01"}]])
----

== `:match` operations

https://docs.xtdb.com/language-reference/datalog-transactions/#match[Match] operations are not yet supported in 2.x - https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/559[coming soon]!

== `:erase` operations

While XTDB by default keeps data forever, 'erase' operations (previously known as https://docs.xtdb.com/language-reference/datalog-transactions/#evict['evict']) allow you to irrevocably delete data from XTDB (e.g. for GDPR 'Right to Erasure' compliance).

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/submit-tx your-node [[:erase :users :jms]])
----

== Transaction functions

XTDB 2.x does support transaction functions in a similar manner to 1.x, although their exact interface is still under active development.

Transaction functions are now run in a https://github.com/babashka/sci[SCI] sandbox.
