= Bench

A rudimentary bench adapted from XTDB 1.x. It currently only runs TPC-H, and only runs it ad-hoc (on Fargate) - it doesn't have any of the daily scheduling.

Dependencies:

- AWS CLI (Arch: `aws-cli` or `aws-cli-v2-bin` from the AUR) + credentials set up

All run through scripts in `./bin`:

- `run-cloudformation.sh` - updates the CloudFormation stack (`./cloudformation/bench.yml`)
- `ecr-login.sh` - logs you in to ECR so that you can push the Docker image
- `build-docker.sh` - builds the bench Docker image
- `push-docker.sh` - pushes the bench Docker image
- `run-bench.sh tpch [--scale-factor 0.01] [--count 1]` - kicks off an ECS job.
- `run-bench.sh ts-devices [--size <small|med|big>] [--count 1]` - kicks off an ECS job.
