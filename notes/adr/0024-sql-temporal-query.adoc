= 24. SQL temporal query

Superseded - see https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/339[#339].

== Context

SQL:2011 by default queries all of application time.
This is likely not what we want.

We could consider augmenting the SQL:2011 with similar clauses for application time:

`SELECT foo.x FROM foo FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2001-01-01' WHERE foo.id = 1`

DB2 supports the above, but they call their application time period `BUSINESS_TIME`.
The above is redundant though, and can be specified like this using the standard:

`SELECT foo.x FROM foo WHERE foo.id = 1 AND foo.valid_time CONTAINS DATE '2001-01-01'`

Inner joins between two tables across application time are done via `OVERLAPS`:

`SELECT foo.x, bar.y FROM foo, bar WHERE foo.id = 1 AND foo.valid_time OVERLAPS bar.valid_time`

This would return all valid rows across time, according to the standard.
Note that in joins it’s in theory enough to limit the time via `AS OF` or predicates for one of the participating tables, as `OVERLAPS` would propagate this.

We will only support a single application time period, called either `VALID_TIME`, `VALID_TIME` or `BUSINESS_TIME` (DB2).
Note that periods in SQL:2011 are really an alias for a pair of columns, like `VALID_TIME_FROM` and `VALID_TIME_TO`.
This shorthand can only be used in places that explicitly expects a period, and cannot be part of `SELECT` for example.

To be semi-compliant with SQL:2011, one idea is to default `VALID_TIME` to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (like `SYSTEM_TIME`), unless one is explicitly accessing `VALID_TIME` or `SYSTEM_TIME` columns or periods inside the query.
This is to avoid having to provide `AS OF CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for every table in the very common case of querying the current state of the database.

Another alternative is to introduce session variables one can set, which provide defaults.
This is useful as either wants to override `VALID_TIME` across the entire query.
It could also be used to set it to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and override standards behaviour.
Explicit access to `VALID_TIME` inside the query would override the default.

`SYSTEM_TIME` semantics can be left as is, as it’s both has a sane default and is less common to override.
If one introduce session variables, one could provide one for `SYSTEM_TIME` as well.

If we build SQL:2011 compliant semantics first, with an option to keep to it, we can then experiment with what extensions we actually need in practice.
All these extensions will only be sugar and won’t change the underlying semantics or feature set.
