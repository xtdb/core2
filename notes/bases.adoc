= Bases

XT footnote:[Most of this applies to Core1 and core2 - I'll explicitly differentiate between them where applicable.] queries and transactions are run against a 'basis'.
This is required by the following constraints, in particular:

* We'd like to preserve a strong 'referential integrity' - if a user runs the same query with the same arguments/options, no matter when or which node it hits, it should return the same results (unexpected errors aside) - often referred to as 'repeatable queries'.
* XT nodes ingest transactions serially but asynchronously from a transaction log - a node may be up-to-date with the head of the log, it may be a few transactions behind, or it may be a _long_ way behind (e.g. if it's reindexing).
  Users should still be able to 'read their writes' though - to see the effects of a transaction they've submitted in a subsequent query.
* XT ingestion must be deterministic, because it is run independently, without inter-node communication, on multiple nodes - we cannot have two nodes in a different (observable) end state having indexed the same transactions.
* Clocks on different nodes aren't assumed to be completely in sync - even that there is an upper bound on clock skew.
  footnote:cockroach[aside: CockroachDB https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/operational-faqs.html#what-happens-when-node-clocks-are-not-properly-synchronized[does assume] that all clocks in a cluster are within 500ms of each other]
* Data inserted into the future should 'become visible' at the appropriate time.
  e.g. if I insert a document to become valid at 16:00, the app-time default should behave such that I don't see the document if I query at 15:59, but I should if I query after 16:00.
+
(This should apply even if there aren't any transactions flowing through the system at the time.
For example, at one JUXT client they have a very low write throughput - they make the bulk of their writes first thing in the morning, in the app-time future, to take effect throughout the day.)

To achieve repeatable queries, it's necessary that the query execution doesn't have any 'co-effects' - anything that can affect the results must be bundled up as an argument submitted with the query.

In practice, for core2
footnote:[In Core1, we don't have `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and friends, but we  do run queries 'as of' a valid-time. We also don't have TZs]
, this means:

* the current time - e.g. for functions like `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, used explicitly or implicitly
* how many transactions to take into account - 'current sys-time'.
* a default timezone - in SQL, there are a lot of functions/type-casts whose behaviour depends on the 'session timezone'
  footnote:utc[yes, I know, we could just make everyone use UTC - but this isn't difficult, and it makes us spec-compliant.]

If a user specifies values for all of these parameters, they should get the same results every time.
That said, from a UX point-of-view we don't want to burden the user with supplying all of these parameters to every query.
What should their defaults be?

Generally speaking, even though we love repeatable queries, we'd like the default behaviour to mirror a traditional database - the same query (without explicit basis parameters), run multiple times, should include new results as they come in.

== tl;dr

* If the user doesn't provide basis params (which we expect to be the majority of the time), their defaults will be:
** for ingest: sys-time and current-time both determined by the tx-log (`LogAppendTime`)
** for queries:
*** sys-time: latest-completed tx of the receiving node (the node being queried).
*** current-time: current time on the receiving node.
* If the user does provide basis params, we ensure repeatable reads.
* For a user to 'read their writes', they receive a receipt from `submit-tx`, which they then pass back as a query argument.
** The receipt from `submit-tx` should contain _both_ basis params footnote:[it currently just contains sys-time, in Core1 and core2], so that both are set on the query:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(let [!tx (xt/submit-tx node [...])]
  (prn @!tx)
  ;; => {:sys-time #inst "2022-08-29T11:00:00Z",
  ;;     :current-time #inst "2022-08-29T11:00:00Z"}
  ;; N.B. these are guaranteed to be the same - we include them both for ease of UX

  (prn (xt/query node "SELECT ..." {:basis !tx})))
----
+
More details below.
* When we need a definite 'happens-before' property, we use one clock - the tx-log's clock - as the single source of wall-clock time.

== Impact on ingestion

Ingestion is a little simpler than queries:

* Because transaction ingestion is http://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable[strict serializable], the value for this must always be 'all of the preceding transactions please'.
* Nodes _do_ agree on the order of transactions, thanks to the tx-log.
* We also use the transaction time as decided by the log.
* We have to assume that ingesting nodes are indexing the transactions at different times - so the 'current time' for a given transaction also has to be consistent across the cluster.
+
We therefore set `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` within a transaction to be the same as the transaction time.
* We assume that the user's intent for timestamps without a TZ is that they are relative to the client's TZ. footnote:utc[]
The ingesting nodes may not share a default TZ - so this is set by the submitting node, and goes on the tx-log.

== Impact on queries

Right, so, as a first pass, it seems like 'current app-time' and 'current sys-time' should both just default to 'now'.

Here's where it gets fun:

* "Do we need a basis at all? Couldn't we just get users to use SQL:2011's system-time syntax if they want repeatable queries?"
+
Unfortunately this isn't sufficient for truly repeatable queries - the query will still depend on how many transactions the node's ingested.
Consider a query like `SELECT ... FROM ... FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS AT <Friday 5pm>` - if there were transactions at 4pm and 4:30pm, a node that's only indexed one of these may still return different results to a node that's indexed both (or neither!).
+
The basis therefore upper-bounds any system-time constraints in the query - the above query executed with a basis of 3pm should not return any data from transactions after 3pm, even though the in-query constraint specifies 5pm.
* Rather than 'now', we default the 'current sys-time' to the latest indexed tx at the time the query's run.
+
This is again because of the asynchronous ingestion - if latest-indexed tx is 16:30, and we default the basis to now (17:00, say), we will get different results for the same arguments once the transaction at 16:45 is indexed.
If we instead default to latest-indexed-tx, this issue goes away.
footnote:[This is more of an issue in Core1, because it has separate `await` and `db` APIs - we have to validate that the tx-time passed to `db` has been correctly awaited.
In core2, it's one API call, so we await the transaction and then run the query.]
+
If the user explicitly supplies 'now', the node then has to wait (possibly indefinitely, if there are no more transactions) for a later transaction to be indexed.
It may also become an issue if we were to allow the user to retrieve the effective basis of a query as metadata on the results - this would allow a user to query the latest results now but store the basis to repeat the query later.
* For app-time, SQL:2011 doesn't add any filters here by default, so we'll likely be recommending liberal use of `WHERE VALID_TIME CONTAINS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
footnote:[or https://github.com/xtdb/core2/issues/339[introducing a flag that does this for them]]
Without fixing `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to the basis value, these queries wouldn't be repeatable.
(Indeed, the SQL:2011 spec says to fix the value of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` within a transaction, exactly for this reason).
* Reading your writes: if the node you happen to query hasn't indexed your transaction yet, you won't see its effects.
** Here, we ask the user to submit a lower-bound for the transaction basis if they want to read their writes - when they submit a transaction, they get a 'receipt'; when they query, they pass this receipt back to XT.
Then, the queried node waits until it's indexed at least that transaction (or hits the user-provided timeout) before it runs the query.
** It's important that the user also sets 'current-time' on read-your-write queries.
Let's say they didn't, and that the receiving server node's clock was sufficiently far behind the tx-log's clock.
footnote:[yes, this https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/issues/1665[actually happened]]

--
* We submit a transaction at 16:00 tx-log time, 15:59 node time.
* The transaction inserts a doc, valid from `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (i.e. 16:00, because we've defaulted it to be the same as tx-log time)
* The node awaits the transaction, and wants to read its write, so it submits a query with sys-time basis 16:00, app-time defaulting to node clock of 15:59:30.
* It doesn't see the doc, because it's not valid yet.

To ease the UX here (as outlined in the xref:tldr[tl;dr] above), the `submit-tx` should return a receipt of the form that the user can directly pass back to `query` to get a repeatable read.
